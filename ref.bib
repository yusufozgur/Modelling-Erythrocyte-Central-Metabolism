  author    = "Stocchi, V and Magnani, M and Canestrari, F and Dach{\`a}, M and
               Fornaini, G",
  abstract  = "Human red blood cell hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) has been shown to
               exist in multiple molecular forms which are separable by ion
               exchange chromatography. Of the major forms, designated
               hexokinase Ia, Ib, and Ic, only hexokinase Ia corresponds to
               hexokinase type I from human liver, while the others differ from
               every other previously reported hexokinase isozyme. Hexokinase
               Ib is the predominant form in the fetal erythrocytes, while it
               is present at lower levels in the red blood cells of adults.
               Analysis of the hexokinase isozymic pattern in red cells of
               different mean age shows that the level of hexokinase Ib is also
               dependent on the age of the cell. The three major forms of
               hexokinase have the same molecular weight of 100,000, by
               sedimentation velocity on sucrose density gradients, the same
               Michaelis constants, substrate and coenzyme specificity,
               pH-dependent activity, and the same thermal stability. The only
               significant differences were found in the isoelectric points
               which were 5.7 pH units for hexokinase Ia, 5.5 pH units for
               hexokinase Ib, and 5.35 pH units for hexokinase Ic. These data,
               together with that previously reported for rabbit erythrocytes
               (Stocchi, V., Magnani, M., Canestrari, F., Dach{\`a}, M., and
               Fornaini, G. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 7856-7861) suggest that
               the presence of multiple forms of hexokinase is a common
               phenomenon in mammalian red blood cells.",

  abstract  = "UNLABELLED: Glycolysis is the main pathway for ATP production in
               the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and essential for its
               survival. Following a sensitivity analysis of a detailed kinetic
               model for glycolysis in the parasite, the glucose transport
               reaction was identified as the step whose activity needed to be
               inhibited to the least extent to result in a 50\% reduction in
               glycolytic flux. In a subsequent inhibitor titration with
               cytochalasin B, we confirmed the model analysis experimentally
               and measured a flux control coefficient of 0.3 for the glucose
               transporter. In addition to the glucose transporter, the
               glucokinase and phosphofructokinase had high flux control
               coefficients, while for the ATPase a small negative flux control
               coefficient was predicted. In a broader comparative analysis of
               glycolytic models, we identified a weakness in the P. falciparum
               pathway design with respect to stability towards perturbations
               in the ATP demand. DATABASE: The mathematical model described
